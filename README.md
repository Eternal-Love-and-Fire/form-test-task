- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **Zod**: For schema validation, ensuring data integrity.
- **React Hook Form**: Efficient and flexible form handling with minimal re-rendering.
- **Shadcn**: A utility library for shadow DOM and component styling.
- **Pixel Perfect Design**: Aimed to closely match the design specs.
